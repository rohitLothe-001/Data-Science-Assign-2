Exploring the dataset:

Start with basic statistical summaries (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
Check for missing values
Examine data types of each feature


Converting Categorical values to Numerical:

Use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding
Consider ordinal encoding if there's a natural order to categories


Plotting Heatmap:

Use a correlation matrix to visualize relationships between features
Pay special attention to correlations with the dependent variable


Data Visualization:

Create scatter plots, box plots, or pair plots to visualize relationships
Consider histograms or density plots for individual features


Plotting Skew and Kurtosis:

Calculate skewness and kurtosis for each numerical feature
Visualize distributions to identify potential transformations needed


Data Preparation:

Handle any missing values
Perform feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization)
Consider feature engineering or selection



7-10. Prediction using various models:

Split data into training and testing sets
Implement and train each model (Linear Regression, SVR, Ridge, Random Forest)
Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared)


Hyperparameter tuning:


Use techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization
Consider cross-validation to ensure robust results


Comparing model performance:


Create a bar plot or table to compare metrics across models
Consider visualizing predictions vs actual values for each model
